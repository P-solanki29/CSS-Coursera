    <h class="highlight">Element with class Selector</h1>
        <p> As an example, here you can see on the right that p class="big" will get to text size 20px, as opposed to all the other elements that have a class="big" will not get that same 20 pixel font size styling. This technique is pretty commonly used
            when you have a CSS class definition that applies to different elements but when it's applied to a particular element you would like the styling to slightly change.</p>
