        <h2>Subheading 1 (h2) </h2>
        <p class="highlight">
            Next is the class selector, and the class selector is specified with a dot and the name of the class. In this case again, we're creating a blue class, a blue CSS class, that will color whatever it targets with the color blue.
            <div class="highlight">The class selector does require a little bit of a change to your HTML document in that each element that you want that class applied to has to have a attribute class equal to the class name. So in this case we have a p, the paragraph tag and
                div tag both have the attribute class="blue" and therefore, their content or their text content will be colored blue</div>
        </p>
        <h2>Subheading 2 (h2)</h2>
        <p class="highlight">In summary, we spoke about the syntax of simple CSS selectors. We spoke about the element selector, the class selector, that you remember to define with a dot right in front of the name, without th e space. And the id selector, that you can find
            with a pound sign, right before the value of the id and the HTML page, again, without the space in between. Next, we're going to talk about combining selectors to create a more targeted selection within the document object model.</p>
